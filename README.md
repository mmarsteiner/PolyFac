One of my goals has been to integrate arbitrary polynomial factorization in **Q**[x] into an open-source repository that I have used in the past, PineappleCAS. It proved challenging and very tedious to do so in plain C, so I am using this repository to work on a C++ implementation of the necessary data structures and algorithms which can hopefully be integrated more easily after they have been tested.
